Roadmap to learn React Native from Scratch

Please follow the current trainings and make sure of pushing everything to a public respository, I'll need you to make this repository public in order to review and answers any questions that you may have.

## [GitHub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk)
You will need how to manage your repos and know to contribute in a collaborative development, is also a good practice to follow all your progress and tracking your changes on your projects.

## [Basic JavaScript:](https://youtu.be/ec8vSKJuZTk?si=YofvwKFoUwf5EATJ)
This is a simple JS course but it will help you to understand the interaction of Javascript with the DOM.

## [TypeScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56mG7DezGs)
This is a basic course, it will give you a notion of the general usage of TS.

## [Advanced TypeScript (Optional)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30LWjhZzg50)
If you have some doubts on typing or just simply want to be better using TypeScript, take a look at this course.

## [React](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux)
This is a really good course it helps you to understand the logic behind react and the component lifecycle, there is also some introduction to redux, please focus on the domponent and redux side, it is not required to learn webpack, routing or another things related to web nut it's up to you, eventually opportunities to work on this will appear.

## [React Native](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-native-the-practical-guide)
This is the most important course please try to learn everything and complete al the exercises, there are other thigns that I want to show you after this like CI/CD with AppCenter

## [Redux Toolkit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbkBuqC1rU4)
This should be enough to understand the state management with redux toolkit, it's an easier way to implement redux.

## [Redux Saga](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L99n06F2rU&list=PLMV09mSPNaQlWvqEwF6TfHM-CVM6lXv39)
This is also important, redux saga has a better async state managent compared with redux thunk or other state managements as mobx.

## [Bash Script](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK9Oc6AEnR4)
Finally you will learn a bit of how to manage your own bash scripts, this will help us for CI/CD.
